[SUAVE Playground](https://github.com/halo3mic/suave-playground) by [Miha](https://twitter.com/MihaLotric). This repository serves as a guide for setting up a local environment to build and submit Goerli blocks to Flashbots's relay using Suave.

[SUAVE Foundry Template](https://github.com/mehranhydary/suave-template) by [Mehran](https://twitter.com/mehranhydary) is an alternate approach to using Foundry than you'll find in the SUAPP Examples repo.
