[Arena X on SUAVE](https://github.com/mehranhydary/arena-suave) by [Mehran](https://twitter.com/mehranhydary/status/1727849740333703310). This is a MEV application that takes orders from users on any chain, lets searchers execute user orders on any chain, and then returns the outputs to the user. Use Arena X to trade any token and be safe from MEV.
